- At the beginning of the presentation, we could Mad Lib the Cat Cafe name
 - "Can I get an adjective? and a noun?" ok
 - When we're creating our cat cafe name, I'll bring up that name (e.g. Red Wheelbarrow Cat Cafe)

- Have 3 columns, cats, locations, drinks
  - Will all be hard-coded at first, then move cats to a service, then move cats to a persistent service
- Have 2 pages (to demonstrate ngRoute)
