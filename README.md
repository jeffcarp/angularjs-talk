ng-talk
==============

This guide is being prepared as a handout for the SF HTML5 Livecode meetup group but I intend for it to stand alone as a light introduction to Angular.

```
HTML5 Live Code Meetup
7pm, Thursday April 24, 2014
Startup House, 934 Howard St., San Francisco, CA
```

## Assumptions

- You are familiar with JavaScript
- You are interested in Angular
- You enjoy the company of felines

## Reasons to use Angular

> HTML enhanced for web apps
>
> – angularjs.org

(what if you wanted a cat picture and could just write `<cat-picture></cat-picture>`?)

> It's what Google's vision for what a browser would be like if it were built from the ground up (instead of just rendering documents.
>
> – Misko Hevery

jQuery approach:

- State stored in variables or in the DOM
- Attach event handlers manually
- Event handlers manage DOM themselves

Angular approach:

- Just manage your data structures and write the HTML once, Angular will take care of the rest for you

## Structure of this talk

Did you hear? A Cat Cafe is coming to San Francisco. But cats are so difficult to manage! So we're going to build a CMS.

Not a Content Management System, a **Cat Management System**.

- {{one-way-binding}}
- `ng-app`
- Controllers
- `ng-view`
- Two-way binding with `ng-model`
- Directives
- Persistence with Firebase and AngularFire
