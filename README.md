ng-talk
==============

This guide is being prepared as a handout for the SF HTML5 Livecode meetup group but I intend for it to stand alone as a light introduction to Angular.

```
HTML5 Live Code Meetup
7pm, Thursday April 24, 2014
Startup House, 934 Howard St., San Francisco, CA
```

## Assumptions

- You are familiar with JavaScript
- You are interested in Angular
- You enjoy the company of felines

## Reasons to use Angular

### *"HTML enhanced for web apps"*

– angularjs.org

### *"It's what Google's vision for what a browser would be like if it were built from the ground up (instead of just rendering documents."*

– Misko Hevery

### *"[the] Best way to understand angularjs is to see angular not so much as a javascript library but as enhanced HTML."*

– Amit Upadhyay - http://amitu.com/angularjs/

## Structure of this talk

Did you hear? A Cat Cafe is coming to San Francisco. But cats are so difficult to manage! So we're going to build a CMS.

Not a Content Management System, a **Cat Management System**.
